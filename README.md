# CppTestCovReporting

Coverage reports are generated by GitHub Actions and uploaded to coverage.io.

- Workflow: `.github/workflows/coverage.yml`
- Required secret: `COVERAGE_IO_TOKEN`
- Optional override: set `COVERAGE_IO_UPLOAD_URL` in the workflow if your coverage.io endpoint differs.
- Jekyll/GitHub Pages deployment workflow is not used in this setup.
